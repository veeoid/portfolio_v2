I wanted a minimal yet modern portfolio website that feels clean, responsive, and fast while clearly representing my projects, skills, and achievements.

This portfolio highlights my:

- Real-world Projects
- Technical Skills
- Publications
- Contact Info
- Timeline / Experience Journey

## How To Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/veeoid/portfolio_v2.git
cd portfolio-redesign
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

This portfolio website is deployed on:  
🔗 [https://portfolio-ca88.vercel.app/](https://portfolio-ca88.vercel.app/)

## Contact Form Backend

The contact form is powered by a Netlify serverless function at `/.netlify/functions/contact`.
It validates input and sends email via SendGrid, so you only need to configure the following environment variables in Netlify:

- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
- `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`
- `SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL`

For small portfolios, Netlify functions are included in the free tier.
